# CarbonChatBubbles

Adds chat bubbles above player's heads when they type in chat.  

Requires [CarbonChat](https://github.com/Hexaoxide/Carbon) and [Paper](https://papermc.io/).  
Display Entities are used for the bubbles, so no resource packs or armor stands are used.

Plugin is provided AS-IS, reported issues and bugs will be fixed at a low priority.
